My full name is Rodrigo Volmir Rezende Anderle, I am a postdoctoral research in health economics in a realy nice project called [DSAIDS](https://isc.ufba.br/dsaids/), about the effects of Social Determinants of Health on HIV/AIDS. I have PhD in [Applied Economics by the Federal University of Bahia](https://pgedu.faced.ufba.br/), and a Master degree in [Regional Economis by the Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/ppgecon). My undergrad was also in [Economics at the University of Caxias do Sul](https://www.ucs.br/ciencias-economicas).
I really like the idea of consider my self a researcher. I like to work with data, econometric and bibliometric analysis. But, my method of interest at the moment is model simulation, particularly agent-based model. I really like the Complex Science approach and I am always trying to implement this view on my framework. 
I am still trying to conciliate work, research and life. I like to full me about this. Anyway, I am not interested in be special, I just would like to live in a confortable way. Also, I would like to help to build a better world. Probably a world where we can conciliate life, work and anything else.
I am also a fresh fater and husband. Its of my desire to make this blog a point of intersection of these dimensions and see what we got from this. 

Previosly this blog, I already try other tow times. One more focus on regional economics analysis, where I was trying to find a way to implement what I have learned in my master and get some money withou have a fix job. Didn't work. The other was another try to implement some of my expertisse using R-Bookdown. It was nice, but at some point I didn't have the energy to follow. Now, I am here starting all over again. For some reason I think is more interesting than try to reburn my older blogs. 
Almost forgot, this is me:
